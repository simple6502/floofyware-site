                        <p>Hello! My name is Nathan Beaudoin, also known as Nix online, and I am currently attending Rutgers University in New Brunswick as an undergraduate, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Cognitive Science as well as a minor in Philosophy. I am eager to engage in research both within the university and independently, which is why I created this site!</p>
                        <p>I have graduated from Tiverton High School in Rhode Island, where I had the opportunity to work as a "Technology Assistant & AI Advisor" for over two years while still a student. I helped the district create guidelines for both the appropriate use of AI, and when it should not be used.</p>
                        <p>I was also able to teach part of an "Introduction to AI" class during my senior year, discussing many of the recent advancements in AI and how they came to be.</p>
                        <p>As I enter university, I want to continue learning and sharing my knowledge with others. I also look forward to become a full-time deep learning researcher after graduation. Although I am young and still learning so much, I want to help develop this technology safely and ethically, as it has the potential to benefit all of humanity if done right.</p>

                <h2>About Floofyware Research</h2>
                <div class="about-container">
                    <div class="about-text">
                        <div class="about-text">
                            <p>There hasn't been much research or advancement in training large deep learning models on very limited computing power, as it has often been overlooked recently in favor of scaling up models and training them with terabytes of data. I want to change that by training powerful models purely on my personal workstation, using optimizations everywhere to get the most out of the hardware.</p>
                            <p>I will release every model I create as open-source, including training data, except for some experimental models that might use data from artists I work with to respect their wishes and work. However, all the research and details will be published for others to build upon for those models still.</p>
                            <p>I firmly believe that fully open-source AI is the path forward for us all to develop universally safer and more ethical AI to improve the quality of humanity while mitigating the existential risks that come with this technology. I also want to show that powerful models can be created with very limited computing power, as not everyone has the money to purchase or rent powerful hardware to perform experiments and develop their own models.</p>
                            <p>My goal is to help develop safer, better, and environmentally friendly AI by focusing on data quality and algorithmic improvements rather than heavy scaling. I will leave no GPU idle!</p>
                            <p>This site holds my research blog as well as my personal blog for when I publish research or other things I find worth in sharing. If you want to learn more about me or contact me, visit my about/contact page.</p>
