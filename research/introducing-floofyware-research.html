                <p>Over the past two years, I have experimented with various AI models, including large language models ranging from GPT-J to the current LLaMA 3.1 models. During this time, I wondered what it would be like to train my own models from scratch using my own hardware. There were numerous resources and models available with a similar idea, but almost all of them were either toy models, trained on outrageously expensive hardware, or trained using cloud compute.</p>
                <p>I wanted to take a step in a direction that has not been investigated much: the training of semi-powerful AI models using very little computing power, opting for algorithmic improvements rather than scale in terms of both model size and dataset size.</p>
                <p>With all that in mind, I decided to start this personal AI research initiative for both personal and research use to document my findings and share them with the open-source community. I believe that semi-powerful general models can now be created with very limited computing power, achieving performance comparable to some models trained with significantly more computing power just 2-3 years ago.</p>
                <p>I will be using my personal workstation, which consists of two 3090 GPUs that will be the compute devices used for the training of such models.</p>
                <p>My first research project, a multi-billion parameter large language model that I will then further expand on with different techniques, has been progressing well. I have been learning a lot about working within the constraints of my computing power and I plan to share more information about this project as I finalize the details for training.</p>
                <p>Keep a look out!</p>
